# Structuring Backbone Code with RequireJS and Marionette Modules

This code repository is the companion to my book on [using RequireJS with Marionette.js](https://leanpub.com/structuring-backbone-with-requirejs-and-marionette).

Even if you don't have the book, you can learn a lot from looking through the commit history. But if you're serious about wanting to become competent with RequireJS (and save time dealing with errors), I suggest you consider purchasing the book: typical mistakes and various tips, techniques, and explanations are indicated in the book and absent from this repository.
